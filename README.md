## Creation of Eva
I first learned about functions like speechsynthesis() and speechrecognition(), and with that a made a bad prototype that really didnt reach my expectations.

<br>
But now i finally had courage enough to start on another project, which was Eva the assistant.
<br>
The main functionallity of Eva is all wrote in javascript, and runs in most native browsers.
<br>
<br>
The character is made in a little abnormal way, its made with a software by FaceRig called Animaze, and edited to my desire in Wondershare Filmora. I started by recording a 10 second video of the idle animation, and then 10 seconds where the mouth was moving, then i just use css display styling to hide and show the 2 different videos when needed.
