#### Hello
I first started using functions like SpeechSynthesis and SpeechRecognition a few years back, and thought i would make an improved version.
[The old voice assistant](https://codezhifty.github.io/codezhifty/projects/voiceassistant/)
<br>
After making the old version i always looked back with dissapointment on it, because it didnt turn out as i intended.
<br>
So i started making the new and improved one. My intention this time was to make a chracter that spoke to you instead of just an hud with the commands showing up.
<br>
I have used a few different api's in my project, including googles youtube search api, openweathermap api and the wikipedia api. All of these is used to make the chat bot more intelligent.
<br>
The wikipedia api is used for gathering intilligence so that the bot can answer most types of factual question.
